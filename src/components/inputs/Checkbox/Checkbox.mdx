# Checkbox

> A primitive for toggling between two states. They are functionally an individual checkbox under the hood, but styled more like
> a [Button](?path=/docs/inputs-checkbox--documentation).

## Example

<Source dark />

## States

There are four checkbox states, defined as `unchecked`, `checked`, `indeterminate` and `disabled`.

### Unchecked

> The `primary` level should be used as the main call to action within a page or checkbox group.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={CheckboxStories.Unchecked} />
</Canvas>

#### Description

> The `primary` level should be used as the main call to action within a page or checkbox group.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={CheckboxStories.Description} />
</Canvas>

### Checked

> The `secondary` level should be used as a secondary call to action within a page or checkbox group.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={CheckboxStories.Checked} />
</Canvas>

### Indeterminate

> The `tertiary` level should be used as any checkbox that is not a call to action or destructive.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={CheckboxStories.Indeterminate} />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

> The `danger` level should be used for toggling any destructive action.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={CheckboxStories.Disabled} />
</Canvas>
