# Box

A box is a primitive for controlling component padding and gutters.

Use boxes to establish a consistent approach to constructing more complicated components, ensuring their paddings
are aligned with the theme. This can be used as a wrapping element for compound components and its prop API included to 
give the component gutter support.


## No gutter

This is the default for boxes. It has no vertical or horizontal padding.
