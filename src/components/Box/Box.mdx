# Box
> A primitive for controlling gutters and elevation. Use boxes to establish a consistent approach to constructing more 
complicated components, ensuring their paddings and shadows are aligned with the theme. This can be used as a wrapping element
for compound components and its prop API included to give the component gutter and shadow support.
