# Logo

> A primitive for rendering the Lapidist logo. The logo always 'appears' rather than render immediately.

## Example

<Source dark />

## Controlling animation

The `animation` prop controls the way the logo appears. There are two available gutters, defined as `fade` and `slide`.

### Fade

> Use the `fade` animation for logos that aren't the primary logo of the page.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={LogoStories.FadeAnimation} />
</Canvas>

### Slide

> Use the `slide` animation for the primary logo on the page (e.g. within the header).

<Canvas>
    <Story of={LogoStories.SlideAnimation} />
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable />
